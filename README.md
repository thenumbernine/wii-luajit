### LuaJIT for Wii via devkitPro

I forget what hoops I had to jump through to get it to build

libdl was missing from Wii so I just made a macro-based glue function generator and baked all the functions directly into it.

Looks like it uses the gx system.

ext is an older copy of my lua-ext GitHub project

Best of luck with this one.
